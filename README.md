### Hello There âœ‹
My name is Jakub and I'm a C++ and C software engineer from Warsaw, Poland. I am currently studying computer science at an university.<br>
In the future I would love to create mobile applications that will help people and make their life easier thanks to modern solutions.<br>
Recently I became really interested in cryptocurrency. Currently, I'm introducing myself to the fascinating world of Bitcoin and blockchain.
